## 📋 Description

This **Server Monitor Bot** allows you to **monitor multiple VPS servers** in real-time through **Discord webhooks**. The bot collects system metrics like **CPU usage, RAM, Disk, and Network speeds** and sends them periodically to a designated **Discord channel**.

The bot uses **Paramiko SSH** to connect with multiple VPSs and provides updates with **real-time network traffic and all-time traffic statistics**. You can customize the bot with **server names, IPs**, and delay intervals using `.env` configuration.

## ⚙️ Setup & Configuration

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AshfakazeeX/Servermonitor.git
   cd server-monitor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` File:**

   In the root directory, create a `.env` file with the following content:

   ```
   VPS_NAMES=Server1,Server2  # Comma-separated server names
   VPS_IPS=192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2  # Comma-separated VPS IPs
   VPS_USERS=root,admin  # SSH users
   VPS_PASSWORDS=password1,password2  # SSH passwords
   WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-id  # Discord webhook URL
   DELAY=5  # Interval between updates (in seconds)
   ```

4. **Run the Bot:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📌 Usage

Once the bot is running, it will send updates to the specified Discord channel every few seconds (based on the `DELAY` value). It will display:

- Server uptime and OS information
- CPU usage (with per-core stats)
- RAM and Disk usage
- Real-time and all-time network traffic
